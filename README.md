# Whatsapp-Messenger-in-Python

This program reads the phone numbers from .csv file and sends user defined messages to all those numbers on whatsapp.

This program also creates a database file as pywhatkit_dbs.txt which stores date, time, phone number and, message sent to that number.
Note:

You should be logged in on Whatsapp Web through your laptop or PC, otherwise it will miss the messaging timestamp and the code won't execute.

Libraries needed:

1) pywhatkit # To access whatsapp messenger
2) pandas    # To read .csv files and extract phone numbers one-by-one.
